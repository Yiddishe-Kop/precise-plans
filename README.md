# precise-plans

A simple landing page built in vanilla HTML, sprinkled with Tailwindcss 2.0 classes, and some Alpine.js help.

This uses Laravel Mix for asset compilation - the simplest way to get asset compilation with webpack going.

For development:

```
npm run dev
```

For production:

```
npm run build
```
